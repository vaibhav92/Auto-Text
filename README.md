# Auto-Text
Autotext is typing assist for dos. Running as a TSR it pops up a window suggesting possible completes for the currently typed string. I did this project as part of thesis project for masters in Jul,2004 at S.G.S.I.T.S, Indore


Description:
Auto-Text is a software to make life easier for people who usually type long and repetitive
text with their keyboards. These people include programmers to frequently use a single text fragment
throughout their long program. People to use a command line interface come next. In both such cases
the speed of getting work done is roughly proportional to the speed with which text can typed from
the keyboard. Now to improve oneâ€™s typing speed he needs to practice with software such as Typing
tutor etc. Obviously this is a long and cumbersome process. What we need is something that knows
what do we want to type and then type it automatically for us. It should work much like the auto
complete facility available to Visual Basic and Visual C++ programmers. To all such problems
Auto-Text is your best answer.
