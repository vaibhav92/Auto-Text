Dear Sir,

        The MS-DOS kernal communicates with these device drives through I/Q
request packets; the drivers then translate these requests into the
proper commands for the various hardware controllers. In many MS-DOS
systems, including the IBM PC, the most premative parts of the hardware
drivers are located in read only memory (ROM) so that they canbe used by
stand- alone applications,diagnostics, and the system start up                     program.
The terms(resident)and (installable)are used to distinguish between
the driversbuilt into the BIOSand the drivers installed during system
initialization by DEVICE commands discussed in more detail later in this
chapter
